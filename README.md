A Neural Network For Recognition Of Trash

We cite the creators of the dataset:

@article{taco2020,

    title={TACO: Trash Annotations in Context for Litter Detection},
    
    author={Pedro F Proença and Pedro Simões},
    
    journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.06975},
    
    year={2020}
    
}

We are both equaly responsible for all the code we wrote. We allmost accomplished everything pair programming, 
except the network architecture and the two visualisation functions.

There are a few requirements to run the project,
of which pycoco and Cpython may cause some problems installing.

download.py downloads the dataset
after that train can be executed

Since git does not allow us to upload saved networks because of their size, we got a google drive link with a few nets:
