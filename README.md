A Neural Network For Recognition Of Trash

We cite the creators of the dataset:
@article{taco2020,
    title={TACO: Trash Annotations in Context for Litter Detection},
    author={Pedro F Proença and Pedro Simões},
    journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.06975},
    year={2020}
}
We are both equaly responsible for all the code we wrote. We allmost accomplished everything pair programming, 
except the network architecture and the two visualisation functions.

There are a few requirements to run the project,
of which pycoco and Cpython may cause some problems installing.

download.py downloads the dataset
after that train can be executed
